# Debugging
This document provides useful tips to help debug programs.  Unfortunately, it
hasn't been written yet.  For starters, experiment with the `--print-level=9`
and `--sim-print-level=9` command line arguments to the simulator and unit
tests, respectively.  The output provides highly detailed information about
program runtime including (1) each change to machine state, in the form of
micro-ops, (2) stack traces, and (3) system events such as interrupts.
